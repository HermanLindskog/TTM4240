### Probability, statistics and measurements

[[Chapter 2]], and [[Chapter 8]]

Mathematical tools:
- Probability
	- Model a system which has randomised functions and run simulation
- Statistics
	- Once we have that model
	- Extract the results and analyse the data

##### What is probability
Na - number of events of an outcome (like A)
- Random experiement
NÎ© - number of events
- Sample space, all possible values

#### Experiment
Random generic
- Flipping a coin

#### Event
It has an outcome, it will be an integear
- Is it head or tails, is our router using all its capacity
- We are interested in a set of the event
Relative frequency of (H, T, H) is 2/3
Asymptotic is a number of times almost to infinity (many number of experiments)

#### Intersection and union
##### Intersection
In common with each other
##### Union
What A and B have for them self
##### Conditional probability
P(A|B)
- Betinget sannsynlighet

### Total probability
P(A)
Law of total probalitity

#### Bayes formula

Two type of variables
Infinite ~ Continious

r,v, X - distributed function (like gaussian)
discrete - random variable

### Continuous random variables
The sum of all the probabilites will become 1
- For cumulative distrubution function (cdf)
Probability denstity function (pdf)

pdf (density, continious variables) vs pmf (mass, discrete random variables)
pdf - gaussian distribution
pmf - e.g. dices. A value that a random number has the value

#### Uniform distribution
a) Sketch the pdf for the continuous and pmd for the discrete case
- Cointinous uniform, pdf

- Discrete uniform

b) Skecth the cumulative distribution functions for both cases

c) What is the probabiliy that t is less than 4? Is it the same as less than and equal to 4?

### Negatitce exponential distribution (n.e.d)
![[Pasted image 20220829162817.png]]
- All the time variables to calcuta e.g. delay of a packet

#### Bernoulli distribution
Either 0 or 1

##### Relations between distributions
